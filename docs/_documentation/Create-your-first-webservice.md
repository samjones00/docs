title: Create your first WebService
---

This is a quick walkthrough of getting your first web service up and running whilst having a look at the how some of the different components work. 

## Step 1: Download and Install ServiceStackVS 
First we want to install ServiceStackVS Visual Studio extension. The easiest way to do this is to look for it from within Visual Studio by going to `Tools > Extensions and Updates...` and searching the Visual Studio Gallery as seen below.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/master/Images/tools_extensions.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/master/Images/tools_extensions.png)

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/ssvs/search-download.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/ssvs/search-download.png)

Optionally it can be downloaded and installed from the [VS.NET Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5bd40817-0986-444d-a77d-482e43a48da7)

[![VS.NET Gallery Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/servicestackvs/vsgallery-download.png)](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5bd40817-0986-444d-a77d-482e43a48da7)

ServiceStackVS supports VS.NET 2017, 2015 and 2013.

## Step 2: Selecting a template

Once the ServiceStackVS extension is installed, you will have new project templates available when creating a new project. For this example, let's choose ServiceStack ASP.NET Empty to get started.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/ssvs/new-project-empty.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/ssvs/new-project-empty.png)

Once you've created your application from the template, you should have 4 projects in your new solution. If you left the default name, you'll end up with a solution with the following structure.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/ssvs/empty-project-solution.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/ssvs/empty-project-solution.png)

## Step 3: Run your project

Press F5 and run your project!

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/master/Images/empty_project_run.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/master/Images/empty_project_run.png)

#### How does it work?

Now that your new project is running, let's have a look at what we have. The template comes with a single web service route which comes from the request DTO (Data Transfer Object) which is located in the WebApplication1.ServiceModel project under `Hello.cs` file.

```csharp
[Route("/hello/{Name}")]
public class Hello : IReturn<HelloResponse>
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class HelloResponse
{
    public string Result { get; set; }
}
```

The `Route` attribute is specifying what path `/hello/{Name}` where `{Name}` binds it's value to the public string property of **Name**.

Let's access the route to see what comes back. Go to the following URL in your address bar, where <root_path> is your server address.

    http://{BaseUrl}/hello/world

You will see a snapshot of the Result in a HTML response format. To change the return format to Json, simply add `?format=json` to the end of the URL. You'll learn more about formats, endpoints (URLs, etc) when you continue reading the documentation.

If we go back to the solution and find the WebApplication1.ServiceInterface and open the `MyServices.cs` file, we can have a look at the code that is responding to the browser, giving us the `Result` back.

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service
{
    public object Any(Hello request)
    {
        return new HelloResponse { Result = $"Hello, {request.Name}!" };
    }
}
```

If we look at the code above, there are a few things to note. The name of the method `Any` means the server will run this method for any of the valid HTTP Verbs. Service methods are where you control what returns from your service.

## Step 4: Exploring the ServiceStack Solution

The Recommended structure below is built into all ServiceStackVS VS.NET Templates where creating any new ServiceStack project will create a solution with a minimum of 4 projects:

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/solution-layout.png" />

### Host Project

The Host project contains your AppHost that references and registers all your App's concrete dependencies in its IOC. It also contains any Web Assets like any Razor Views, JS, CSS, Images, Fonts, etc. that's needed to deploy with your App. The AppHost is the master project which references all dependencies used by your App whose role is to act like a conduit where it decides which concrete implementations should be used. By design it references everything and nothing references it which as a goal should be kept logic-free.

### ServiceInterface Project

The ServiceInterface project is the implementation project where all Business Logic and Services live which typically references every other project except the Host projects. Small and Medium projects can maintain all their implementation here where logic can be grouped under sub feature folders. Large solutions can split this project into more manageable cohesive and modular projects which we also recommend encapsulates any dependencies they might use.

### ServiceModel Project

The ServiceModel Project contains all your Application's DTOs which is what defines your Services contract, keeping them isolated from any Server implementation is how your Service is able to encapsulate its capabilities and make them available behind a remote facade. There should be the only ServiceModel project per solution which should be impl, dependency and logic-free as Service contracts decoupled from implementation, enforces interoperability ensuring that your Services don't mandate specific client implementations and will ensure this is the only project clients need to be able to call any of your Services using either referencing the **ServiceModel.dll** directly or downloading the DTOs from a remote ServiceStack instance using [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/dtos-role.png)

### Test Project

The Unit Test project contains all your Unit and Integration tests. It's also a Host project that typically references all other non-Host projects in the solution and contains a combination of concrete and mock dependencies depending on what's being tested. See the [Testing Docs](/testing) for more information on testing ServiceStack projects.

### ServiceStack Integration

ServiceStack's clean Web Services design makes it simple and intuitive to be able to call ServiceStack Services from any kind of client from a [simple Bootstrap Website using jQuery](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Templates/blob/master/src/ServiceStackVS/BootstrapWebApp/BootstrapWebApp/default.cshtml):

```html
<div>
    <div>
        <input class="form-control input-lg" id="Name" type="text" placeholder="Type your name">
        <p id="helloResult" style="margin-top: 15px;font-size: large"></p>
    </div>
</div>
<script>
    $('#Name').keyup(function () {
        var name = $('#Name').val();
        if (name) {
            $.getJSON('/hello/' + name)
                .success(function (response) {
                    $('#helloResult').html(response.Result);
                });
        } else {
            $('#helloResult').html('');
        }
    });
</script>
```

To Sophisticated Single Page Apps using [TypeScript JsonServiceClient](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference#typescript-serviceclient), here's an 
[example using React](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Templates/blob/master/src/SinglePageApps/ReactApp1/ReactApp1/src/home/Hello.tsx):

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { client } from '../shared';
import { Hello } from '../dtos';

export default class HelloComponent extends React.Component<any, any> {
    constructor(props, context) {
        super(props, context);
        this.state = { result: '' };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        this.nameChanged(this.props.name);
    }

    async nameChanged(name:string) {
        if (name) {
            let request = new Hello();
            request.name = name;
            let r = await client.get(request);
            this.setState({ result: r.result });
        } else {
            this.setState({ result: '' });
        }
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="form-group">
                <input className="form-control" type="text" placeholder="Your name"
                    defaultValue={this.props.name}
                    onChange={e => this.nameChanged((e.target as HTMLInputElement).value)} />
                <h3 className="result">{this.state.result}</h3>
            </div>);
    }
}
```
