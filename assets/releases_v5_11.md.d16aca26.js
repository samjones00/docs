guided tour highlight video focusing on how AutoQuery services can help developers and non-developers alike get Instant UI access their Systems data.</p><p>ServiceStack Studio can be used for rapid prototyping or as a generic UI to manage services, data, users, permissions and validation. Studio has acquired a number of capabilities &amp; features already that we&#39;ve tried to highlight in this feature video:</p>',8),D=n("iframe",{class:"video-hd",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kN7371bqUII",frameborder:"0",allow:"autoplay; encrypted-media",allowfullscreen:""},null,-1),C=s('<h3 id="value-of-apis" tabindex="-1">Value of APIs <a class="header-anchor" href="#value-of-apis" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A primary goal for ServiceStack is to capture your systems functionality in a typed Service contract that yields the most reusable &amp; evolvable API design. It&#39;s why ServiceStack encourages a contract-first, message-based &amp; coarse-grained typed API Design, which not only benefits the evolution of your Service APIs behind its most reusable form, but also benefits ServiceStack who&#39;s able to maximize the utility of your Services and make it available in multiple endpoints (e.g. HTTP,MQ,gRPC,SOAP,Service &amp; RPC Gateway), call styles &amp; serialization formats, more than any other Services framework.</p><p>The other side of the API boundary is the other important area where APIs can add the most value by making it as simple as possible for API Consumers to call your APIs thereby making your APIs more appealing and creating multiplicative value with the time &amp; effort saved by each API consumer.</p><h3 id="optimal-end-to-end-development-ux" tabindex="-1">Optimal end-to-end development UX <a class="header-anchor" href="#optimal-end-to-end-development-ux" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Providing the best end-to-end API development UX is where ServiceStack has excelled for over a decade where it&#39;s still one of the only solutions allowing for an optimal end-to-end API without code-gen, which it enables for multiple <a href="/csharp-client#built-in-clients">generic .NET Service Clients</a> in multiple <a href="/csharp-client#httpwebrequest-service-clients">text &amp; binary formats</a> all implementing the same substitutable interfaces. This ability is a consequence of design in capturing your entire API boundary into perfectly symmetrical impl-free Service Contracts where the same DTOs Services implement on the Server are also what clients use to invoke APIs.</p><p>The benefit afforded from this design extends to each of the popular Web, Mobile &amp; Desktop <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Add ServiceStack Reference</a> languages ServiceStack natively supports, as they only need be concerned with generating impl-free, declarative DTO Service Contracts in each language. This results in much richer DTOs whose code generation also captures exported interfaces &amp; declarative route information, API metadata &amp; Validation attributes in languages that support it as well as exporting more optimal &amp; specific types as it&#39;s able to translate types directly from .NET&#39;s richer type system instead of the more restrictive primitive data types set found in other generic code-gen solutions.</p><p>The benefits for only needing to generate DTOs is multifold, there&#39;s less boilerplate code to generate, the models are richer, cleaner and more reusable as POCO data models within client applications. They also can used within smart generic Service Clients that maintains higher-level functionality beyond a generic HTTP Client with built-in support for Authentication, Auto Retries, Auto Batched Requests, Stateful Cookie Sessions, etc. wrapped behind a consistent and idiomatic generic client interface.</p><h2 id="instant-client-apps" tabindex="-1">Instant Client Apps <a class="header-anchor" href="#instant-client-apps" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Building upon our native end-to-end typed solutions, we&#39;re excited to announce <strong>Instant Client Apps</strong> to provide instant utility and value around your ServiceStack Services where your API consumers can use the Auto generated UI to craft API Requests in their preferred programming language:</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt=""></p><h3 id="customize-download" tabindex="-1">Customize Download <a class="header-anchor" href="#customize-download" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A benefit to owning the entire code-generation technology stack is being able to control the complete end-user development experience and provide richer more customizable features like choosing to download <strong>all API DTOs</strong>, only DTOs defined within a <a href="/api-design#group-services-by-tag">tag group</a> for Systems that group their APIs into targeted collections (e.g. <code>[web]</code>,<code>[mobile]</code>,<code>[desktop]</code>) whilst users who are only interested in only calling 1 API can download just that <strong>single Request DTO</strong> (inc. all its dependencies) for a much smaller &amp; more tailored download.</p><p><img src="'+p+'" alt=""></p><h3 id="download-zip" tabindex="-1">Download .zip <a class="header-anchor" href="#download-zip" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Instant Client Apps also caters for users that prefer not to install any software who can download a .zip of their Client App pre-configured with their ProjectName that they can unzip and run in their preferred dev environment that way.</p><h3 id="open-instantly-in-preferred-ide" tabindex="-1">Open Instantly in preferred IDE <a class="header-anchor" href="#open-instantly-in-preferred-ide" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>At its most productive, API Users who&#39;ve installed our cross-platform utility will be able to instantly open their crafted API directly in their preferred IDE. The previously time &amp; effort intensive task for users to setup a new development environment to be able to explore your API in their preferred language and IDE is now reduced to seconds.</p><h3 id="mix-into-an-existing-code-base" tabindex="-1">Mix into an existing code-base <a class="header-anchor" href="#mix-into-an-existing-code-base" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Another popular use-case that&#39;s catered for is being able to non-destructively <a href="/mix-tool">mix</a> the client App source files directly into existing code bases, preserving any existing files.</p><p>This is also useful for Client Applications that need to start from an existing scaffolded project template like incorporating their client Dart App into a new Flutter Mobile App as seen in this video:</p>',20),I=n("iframe",{class:"video-hd",src:"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTnuMhvUayg",frameborder:"0",allow:"autoplay; encrypted-media",allowfullscreen:""},null,-1),q=s('<h3 id="share-executable-api-examples" tabindex="-1">Share Executable API Examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#share-executable-api-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A nice feature of Instant Client Apps is that each custom API Example compiles down into a single URL which can be easily shared, linked to and embedded in Docs &amp; Emails. E.g. You can view the Typed Chinook AutoQuery API Example used in the video and docs from the link below:</p><ul><li><a href="https://apps.servicestack.net/#chinook.netcore.io/csharp/AutoQuery/QueryArtists(ArtistIdBetween:%5B1,100%5D,NameStartsWith:F)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps.servicestack.net/#chinook.netcore.io/csharp/AutoQuery/QueryArtists(ArtistIdBetween:[1,100],NameStartsWith:F)</a></li></ul><p>Which captures the remote ServiceStack <strong>BaseUrl</strong>, the <strong>C#</strong> Language to view the example in, the selected <strong>AutoQuery</strong> Tag Group, the <strong>QueryArtists</strong> Request DTO being queried and all its <strong>populated properties</strong>.</p><h3 id="embed-api-examples-to-create-interactive-api-docs" tabindex="-1">Embed API Examples to create Interactive API Docs <a class="header-anchor" href="#embed-api-examples-to-create-interactive-api-docs" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A richer experience you can offer your API Consumers beyond sharing links to API Examples is being able to generate interactive API docs around your APIs.</p><p>To further this goal <a href="https://apps.servicestack.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">apps.servicestack.net</a> also lets you capture API Examples into embeddable iframes that you can embed into your API Docs, e.g:</p><p><a href="https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/doc-generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="'+c+'" alt=""></a></p><p>For a quick preview of this we&#39;ve created an API Docs example site around the Covid Vaccines APIs used in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5crcDfl467Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instant Client Apps Flutter Demo</a> above:</p><h5 id="servicestackapps-github-io-covidvaccinationwatch" tabindex="-1"><a href="https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#servicestackapps-github-io-covidvaccinationwatch" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h5><ul><li><a href="https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/autoquery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QueryData</a></li><li><a href="https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/get-locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get Locations</a></li></ul><p><a href="https://servicestackapps.github.io/CovidVaccinationWatch/autoquery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="'+i+`" alt=""></a></p><p>Here we show an example of skinning the embeddable API Docs inside of our own jQuery UI Tab plugins widget that is then embedded inside the API docs pages.</p><p>Being able to quickly and effortlessly generate beautiful API docs is an area we want to explore more in future. We don&#39;t believe trying to mechanically automate API docs generation is going to result in the best API docs for your end users, instead we envisage it should end up being a mix of static documentation around interactive code examples where you have full flexibility in how its presented to the end user. But it should be something we can provide tools to help scaffold a static site around interactive code examples that they&#39;ll be able to open with a single click directly in their IDE.</p><h3 id="synthesize-api-code-examples" tabindex="-1">Synthesize API Code Examples <a class="header-anchor" href="#synthesize-api-code-examples" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A side-effect of Instant Client Apps being stateless is that they require your API to always be accessible as it uses its API metadata and Server Generated DTOs in order to generate the Client App Source files. It does maintain a short cache of both in order to provide a responsive UX, but otherwise your API needs to be live which is potentially an undesirable trait for API docs that you want users to still be able to read whilst your API is down or undergoing maintenance.</p><p>However this is easy enough to workaround by synthesizing the dynamic source files and publishing them to an immutable gist. To do this you can either download &amp; extract <strong>MyApp.zip</strong> or copy the <strong>MIX INTO DIRECTORY</strong> script to write all the files into a new folder which you can then publish to a gist with the <code>x publish</code> command:</p><div class="language-"><pre><code>$ x publish -desc &quot;Chinook Query Artists Example&quot;

</code></pre></div><p>Going to <a href="https://gist.cafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gist.cafe</a> will let you further customize the embeddable code example and provide multiple embed options, e.g. you can simply replace the gist id in the <code>&lt;script/&gt;</code> tag below:</p><div class="language-html"><pre><code><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class="token attr-name">src</span><span class="token attr-value"><span class="token punctuation attr-equals">=</span><span class="token punctuation">&quot;</span>https://gist.cafe/embed/d3a0dfcd0851d928badad66b90affc06.js<span class="token punctuation">&quot;</span></span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span><span class="token script"></span><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span>

</code></pre><p>As this default convention is so prevalent it has the advantage that modern IDEs like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rider</a> includes UI support where each task can be directly in the UI.</p><h3 id="what-about-net-apps" tabindex="-1">What about .NET Apps? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-about-net-apps" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Without a better alternative available to .NET projects we&#39;ve also resorted to using npm scripts for our project templates that don&#39;t use npm like our <a href="https://www.vuedesktop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vuedesktop.com</a> project template which only uses <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-desktop/blob/master/package.json" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">package.json</a> to maintain scripts of its built-in functionality:</p><p><img src="https://docs.servicestack.net/images/templates/packagejson-scripts-vuedesktop.png" alt=""></p><p>Where they can be run from Rider&#39;s IDE or using npm&#39;s <code>run</code>.</p><h3 id="using-dotnet-tools-to-run-package-json-scripts" tabindex="-1">Using dotnet tools to run package.json scripts <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-dotnet-tools-to-run-package-json-scripts" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Whilst we can assume <strong>node</strong> to be a ubiquitous dependency installed on most Developer workstations, it may not be available in all environments like CI build agents, Docker containers, new VM workspaces, etc.</p><p>So if we&#39;re going to standardize on <strong>package.json</strong> scripts for encapsulating a project template&#39;s functionality we thought it also prudent to offer a .NET only solution to support environments where an npm dependency is not desirable, so we&#39;ve added support for executing npm package.json scripts in our <a href="/dotnet-tool">x</a> and <a href="/netcore-windows-desktop">app</a> dotnet tools using <code>x script</code>, e.g:</p><pre><code>$ x scripts dtos
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s also available from the more wrist-friendly alias <code>x s</code>, e.g:</p><pre><code>$ x s dtos
$ app s dtos
</code></pre><p>Which can be used interchangeably with <code>npm run</code> to execute command scripts on Windows and <code>bash</code> scripts on macOS and Linux or WSL.</p><h3 id="cross-platform-scripts" tabindex="-1">Cross platform scripts <a class="header-anchor" href="#cross-platform-scripts" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Whilst we now have a pure .NET alternative for running <strong>package.json</strong> scripts should we need it, we still have the issue of maintaining scripts to support multiple platforms. Most of the time this isn&#39;t an issue when calling cross-platform tools like <code>x</code> or <code>tsc</code> which supports the same command syntax on all platforms, but it starts to become an issue if also needing to perform some file operations.</p><p>An example of this is the script to generate JS DTOs in our <a href="/create-your-first-webservice#dependency-free-jsonserviceclient--typed-dtos-in-web-pages">pure JS dep-free Project templates</a> which uses TypeScript to transpile the DTOs then needs to move the generated <code>dtos.js</code> to <code>wwwroot</code>. If only needing to support Windows the script would simply be:</p><div class="language-json"><pre><code><span class="token property">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">&quot;dtos&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">&quot;x ts &amp;&amp; tsc -m umd dtos.ts &amp;&amp; move dtos.js wwwroot/dtos.js&quot;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But we&#39;d need to have a different script that uses <code>mv</code> to support macOS &amp; Linux, we could maintain a separate script per platform, e.g:</p><div class="language-json"><pre><code><span class="token property">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">&quot;dtos:win&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span>  <span class="token string">&quot;x ts &amp;&amp; tsc -m umd dtos.ts &amp;&amp; move dtos.js wwwroot/dtos.js&quot;</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>

<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But then anything calling it would also need to be platform specific including docs needing to having to differentiate between which platform-specific scripts to run.</p><p>One solution is to evaluate a node expression that performs the required file operations, e.g:</p><div class="language-json"><pre><code><span class="token property">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">&quot;dtos&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">&quot;x ts &amp;&amp; tsc -m umd dtos.ts &amp;&amp; node -e \\&quot;require(&#39;fs&#39;).renameSync(&#39;dtos.js&#39;,&#39;wwwroot/dtos.js&#39;)\\&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>In a similar vein we can also evaluate a <a href="https://sharpscript.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Script Expression</a> to perform the cross-platform operations, e.g:</p><div class="language-json"><pre><code><span class="token property">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span>
    <span class="token property">&quot;dtos&quot;</span><span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">&quot;x ts &amp;&amp; tsc -m umd dtos.ts &amp;&amp; x -e \\&quot;mv(&#39;dtos.js&#39;,&#39;wwwroot/dtos.js&#39;)\\&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="token punctuation">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Which our latest templates have adopted, that can be run with either <code>npm run</code>, <code>x scripts</code> or its <code>x s</code> alias:</p><pre><code>$ npm run dtos
